# Description
Statistical Foundations of Business Analytics focuses on core concepts and techniques in Statistics that are central to applied work in data analysis and decision making. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply these techniques to real-world datasets, and they will have the necessary knowledge to continue learning about other topics in Statistics in greater autonomy. This course also serves as a foundation for later courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
# Learning Objectives
After completing this course, you will be able to:
• Identify business problems for which different Regression models are appropriate and apply these models to address them. 
• Identify business problems for which different Classification models are appropriate and apply these models to address them.
• Identify business problems that can be addressed using Survival Analysis and use concepts and techniques from Survival Analysis to solve them.
• Use Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.
• Address concerns related to Multiple Hypotheses Testing in a principled way.
• Identify business problems that require the use of Experimentation and make recommendations on the appropriate Experimentation strategies that can be used to address them.
• Use the foundational knowledge developed in this course to learn more about other topics in Statistics and Machine Learning.
