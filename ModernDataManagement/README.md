# Introduction:
Data drives modern business. Transactional data systems keep the worldâ€™s economy operating smoothly by tracking and processing the movement of bits, dollars, atoms, and attention across the planet. Analytic systems help managers understand and optimize their businesses. Robotic systems (both physical machines and software bots) automate a tremendous amount of the work historically done by people. Over the next seven weeks you will learn to use a set of data management tools to capture, manage, and analyze data to do business better, faster, and cheaper.
# Course Objectives:
Students who attend class and complete the assigned work will develop their abilities to use data management tools commonly used in large corporations to collect, clean, integrate, retrieve, and analyze data.
More specifically, by the end of the course students should be able to do the following:
# Mechanical learning objectives:
o Write SQL queries to retrieve data from a relational database and perform basic calculations with that data
o Setup, connect to, and retrieve data from, database servers in the cloud via Amazon Web Services (AWS) and MongoDB's Atlas cloud database.
o Repair or otherwise appropriately deal with data quality problems to improve the quality of a given data set
o Capture, represent, analyze, and manipulate loosely-structured JSON data
o Write queries to retrieve data from a MongoDB Document Database
# Conceptual learning objectives:
o Given a question in a natural language (English in this case), write a query or program to retrieve, transform, and/or compute across a set of data to answer, or help to answer, that question.
o Represent information using a variety of standard data models and frameworks, including the relational data model, {key,value} pairs, and JSON data documents.
o Assess the qualities of a given data set, including its completeness, consistency, accuracy, and timeliness; identify potential biases that may be contained in the dataset; identify specific data quality problems within a given dataset.
o Use data transformation, cleaning, and wrangling tools and techniques to address and repair data quality problems.
