# CMU MS in Business Analytics Curriculum
The Tepper School of Business developed the curriculum for the FT Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) in consultation with global business leaders. The Tepper School determined that the greatest need is 
for professionals who not only have advanced analytical skills, such as machine learning and optimization, but also the appropriate business knowledge and communication skills to solve complex problems and bring 
value to industry.

Methodology, including machine learning and optimization.
Software engineering, including large-scale data management and programming in R and Python.
