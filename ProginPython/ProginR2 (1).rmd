## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```
1.Using the flights dataset and functions from the dplyr library, create a tibble that
summarizes the average gain for the flights of each airline that occurred between july and november
(included). The tibble should have a summary column named average_gain and another column with
the name of the airline. The rows of the tibble should be ordered by average_gain in decreasing order.
Ignore any NAs in the computation of average_gain. Recall that “gain” is defined as arr_delay -
dep_delay.

```{r}
new1<-flights %>% filter(month >= 7 & month <= 11) %>%
  mutate( gain = arr_delay - dep_delay) %>%
  inner_join( airlines,by=c('carrier')) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(average_gain = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_gain))
new1

```
2.Using the diamonds dataset and functions from the dplyr library, find the minimum depth
percentage and the maximum weight (carat) of diamonds that are priced between $1,000 and $2,500
(included), and that have cut quality that is good, very good, or premium.

```{r}

diamonds1<-filter(diamonds,price>=1000 & price<=2500,cut %in% c("Good", "Very Good", "Premium"))
 
fin<-diamonds1%>%
  group_by(cut)%>%
summarize( min_depth_percentage = min(depth), max_weight_carat = max(carat))
fin
```
3.Read the exams.csv dataset, then:
– make it into a tidy tibble
– use functions from the dplyr package on your tidy tibble to create a new tibble with columns
student and pass where student is the student name and pass is "yes" if the average grade of
the student is at least 60 and "no" otherwise
– write this tibble to disk in CSV format. Hint: ? ifelse


```{r}

exams<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\exams.csv")

filter_exams <- mutate(
  exams,
  grade = (exam1+exam2+exam3)/3
)

new_exam<-select(filter_exams,-exam1,-exam2,-exam3)
filter_exam <- mutate(
  new_exam,
  pass = ifelse(grade >= 60, "yes", "no")
)

filter_exam1<-select(filter_exam,-grade)
filter_exam1
file_path <- "C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\sample_data.csv"

# Write the tibble to a CSV file
write_csv(filter_exam1, file_path)

```
4.Read the transactions.csv dataset from the lab of class 4 and make it tidy using the code
from the lab. Using functions from the dplyr library, create a tibble with a single column containing
the unique months in which either Jenna or John had a transaction (either sale or purchase). Hint: ?is.na and ? distinct

```{r}

# Read the full dataset with appropriate types.
transactions <- read_csv(
  "C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\transactions.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    person = col_character(),
    month = col_integer(),
    purchase = col_integer(),
    sale = col_integer()
  )
)
transactions_tidy <-
  transactions %>% gather(purchase,
                          sale,
                          key = transaction_type,
                          value = amount)
transactions_tidy
tidy_transactions<-transactions_tidy%>%
  select(month,person,amount)%>%
  filter(!is.na(person)) %>%
  mutate(person=tolower(person))%>%
  distinct(month,person,.keep_all=TRUE)

unique_months<-tidy_transactions %>%
  filter(person %in% c("jenna","john")) %>%
  distinct(month)

unique_months

```
