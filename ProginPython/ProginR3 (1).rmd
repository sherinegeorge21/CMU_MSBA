## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

Read the persons.csv, food.csv, drinks.csv, and dinners.csv datasets. Create a new
version of the dinners tibble (name it dinners_explicit) that includes exactly the following columns:

```{r}
persons<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\persons.csv")

food<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\food.csv")

drinks<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\drinks.csv")
```
Use the dinners_explicit tibble that you just created to now create a summary tibble for
the 2 most popular drinks and a summary tibble for the 2 most popular foods. Hints: use the head
or tail functions to select the top or bottom rows of a tibble; check out the drop_na function in the
dplyr package to remove rows with missing values

```{r}
dinners<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\dinners.csv")
dinners_explicit<-dinners %>%
  left_join( drinks,by=c('drink_id'='item_id')) %>%
  left_join(food,by=c('food_id'))%>%
  left_join(persons, by=c('person_id'='id'))%>%
  select(item_name,price.x ,name,price.y,first_name,last_name,age) %>% 
  rename("drink" = "item_name",
         "drink_price" = "price.x",
         "food" = "name",
         "food_price" = "price.y")
dinners_explicit

top2_drinks<-dinners_explicit %>%
  group_by(drink) %>%
   drop_na(drink)%>%
  summarise(Count = n())  %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))%>%
   rename("n" = "Count")%>%
   head(2)

 top2_foods<- dinners_explicit %>%
   group_by(food) %>%
   drop_na(food) %>%
   summarise(Count = n()) %>%
   arrange(desc(Count))%>%
   rename("n" = "Count")%>%
   head(2)
 
 top2_foods
 
 top2_drinks
```
Use the summary tibbles for the top 2 drinks and top 2 foods together with the
dinners_explicit tibble to create a tibble that corresponds to all the rows in the dinners_explicit
tibble where the food is in the top 2 foods and the drink is not in the top 2 drinks. Only keep rows
without missing values in your final table.
```{r}
final<-dinners_explicit%>%
   filter(
     food %in% top2_foods$food,
     !(drink %in% top2_drinks$drink),
     !is.na(food) & !is.na(drink)
   )%>%
  drop_na()
final
```
Read the singers.csv dataset
1
– Change the tibble so that all first and last names are lower cased.
– Add a column named full_name obtained by concatenating the first and last name with a single
space between them.
– Use the day, month, year columns to create a column named date_of_birth that with the date
of birth of each singer. The type of this column should be Date (i.e., the tibble should indicate
the type of the column as <date> when you print out the tibble).
– Calculate their current age in years (if all of them were still alive today). Note that this doesn’t
have to be an integer value.
– Filter the tibble so that it only contains the subset of singers whose last name begins with 2
consecutive consonants.

```{r}
singers<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Sherine\\Downloads\\singers.csv")

singers <- singers %>%
  mutate(first_name = tolower(first_name),
         last_name = tolower(last_name))%>%
  mutate(full_name = paste(first_name, last_name, sep = " ")) %>%
  mutate(date_of_birth = make_date(year, month, day))%>%
  mutate(age_today = (today() - date_of_birth) / dyears(1))%>%
  filter(str_detect(last_name,"^[^aeiou]{2}"))

singers

```
